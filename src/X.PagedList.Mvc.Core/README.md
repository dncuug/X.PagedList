# X.PagedList.Mvc.Core

The X.PagedList.Mvc.Core library is a tool designed for ASP.NET Core applications that facilitates pagination of
collections like IEnumerable and IQueryable.

## Important announcement
In a continuous effort to enhance library quality and support, this package has been migrated to X.Web.PagedList.

From now on, please use [X.Web.PagedList](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.Web.PagedList/) instead of this package.

It's important to note that you must update your code to use the `X.PagedList` namespace instead of `X.PagedList.Mvc.Core`.
